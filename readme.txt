  Project : US Bikeshare Data 
   
  
  by Ntare Guy 

  Project Overview:

  In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
  I write code to import the data and compute some descriptive statistics on them. 
  I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


  Data-set sources:

  LYFT a American ridesharing company which operate DIVVY, a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs
